The last project at General Assembly's (GA) Software Engineering Immersive (SEI-Flex) bootcamp was to build a full-stack application with Python Django REST framework for the back-end and ReactJS for the front-end.

We had an option to go the solo route, or do it as a group. I wanted to test out my skills by making a full-stack solo CMS(Content Management System)-ish project.

My initial thoughts for the project were also to make an e-commerce site or social media clone, but I decided to make something more unique rather than just another clone for coding bootcamp.

I have decided to make a project aimed to solve the paper wastage at my current employment. At the moment most of the documents are being filled-in in a paper format and are being transferred to the computer by the administrator.

I was unable to implement all features that I wanted due to time constraints of doing this project while working full-time at my existing employment, which was entering the peak season at the point of making this project.

However, I am happy that I was able to go above the initial MVP, learned to work with Material UI and gained the foundations to work with the Python Django REST framework to build a quite complex API compared to what has been thought during the course.

### <a name='brief'>Brief</a>
